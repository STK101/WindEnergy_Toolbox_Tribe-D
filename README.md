# WindEnergy_Toolbox_Tribe-D
Python Script to get all relevant required Information regarding the Wind-Energy produced.

## Requirements
- Python (Version 3+) - If you're not familiar with python check out this out [Python Official Install](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
- Numpy - If you're not familiar with numpy check out [Numpy Official Install](https://numpy.org/install/)

## Getting Started
Run the "windbox.py" file (if you've never run a python file check this out [Python Run guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-run-python-program))
and everything else of need would be told to you in the scipt itself.

##  8.1 Case Study of Chennai's Wind Energy

  

A case study of potential wind energy production at Chennai was performed.

[@AssessmentWindEnergy]

  

Average windspeed in Chennai= 4.51 m/s

[@1011770144598719875276fig11]

  

Monthly Units at Average Wind Speed ~ 260 units/month (best case assuming 100% effciency)

##  8.2 Formulas Required

  
* $\omega  \leq  \frac{V \ × \ TSR }{ π \ \times \ D }$

* $P_{wind} = (1/2) \times ρ × (πr^2)\times v^3  \times C_p$

* $P_{load} = \tau ×ω$

* $P_{load} \leq P_{wind}$

* $P_{load} = 10.5  \times  60  \times  \omega = 630  \omega$

* $τ \geq  0.136  \times P_{load} \ \ or \ \ 86.1  \times ω \ \ \ \ ∀ \ \ \ P_{load} \leq  1170w \ \ or \ \ ω \leq  1.85hz$

* $τ \leq P_{wind} \ / \ \omega$

  

For $\tau$ to exist : $P_{wind} \ / \ ω \geq  86.1  \times ω$

  

Hence, $0  \leq ω \leq (P_{wind}/86.1)^{1/2}$

Table 8: Abbreviation in the above used formulas

| Abbreviation | Meaning |

|--------------|---------|

| $\tau$ | Torque generated by the wind|

| $P_{\text{wind}}$ | Power of flowing air(wind) |

| $P_{\text{load}}$ | Power input to generator|

|TSR | Tip Speed Ratio(Inherent property) |

| $\omega$| angular velocity of turbine|

| $v$| Velocity of wind|

|$C_p$| Power Coefficient|

  

Now, we have 3 upper limits of omega and our system will run on the largest of these three and accordingly we'll get $P_{load}$ as given.

  

* Relaible Data for wind speeds was available at 50 meters above ground level. As our wind mill is 10 meters above ground, we can use the formula below to approximate wind speed at that height.

  

$v_{10} = v_w(h) \cdot  \left( \frac{h_{10}}{h} \right)^a$

  

From this, we get $4.51$ m/s as stated above.
